All paid subscription terms begin on the 1st day of the next month and continue for 12 months thereafter (each, a \u201cSubscription Term\u201d). Your subscription will automatically renew on an annual basis until terminated pursuant to these Terms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>10.2 If you select a paid tier of Utility Belt in the middle of a calendar month, you may be given free access to such paid tier functionality prior to your first Subscription Term. Such early access will be determined by Dodona in its sole discretion and these Terms will apply to any such access.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>10.3 Pricing for paid tiers of Utility Belt will be quoted based on the features and functionality requested.

Any downgrade will take effect on the first day of the next Subscription Term.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>10.6 Billing disputes must be notified to Dodona in writing before the due date. Delinquent payments may bear interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (or the highest rate permitted by law) from the payment due date until paid in full. You will be responsible for all reasonable expenses (including attorneys\u2019 fees) incurred by Dodona in collecting delinquent amounts. If delinquent fees are not paid, Dodona will automatically downgrade your account to a free account and\/or suspend or terminate your use of the relevant Services. Downgrading your account may cause the loss of features, functionality or capacity and Dodona shall not be liable for any losses associated with downgrading or terminating your account.
