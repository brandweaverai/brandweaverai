This was resolved.\" class=\"wp-image-1144\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The front-end catches this flow and guides the user to connect a local chain or connect via MetaMask. This fix also solved the large number of getBalance() requests. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"511\" src=\"https:\/\/brandweaver.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/image-1024x511.png\" alt=\"Sidekik now offers better messaging when there is an error to improve the user onboarding experience.\" class=\"wp-image-1145\" srcset=\"https:\/\/brandweaver.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/image-1024x511.png 1024w, https:\/\/brandweaver.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/image-300x150.png 300w, https:\/\/brandweaver.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/image-768x383.png 768w, https:\/\/brandweaver.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/image-1536x766.png 1536w, https:\/\/brandweaver.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/image-2048x1022.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Better Error Messaging via Console.Logs \ud83d\udc7e<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Users asked for improved browser console.logs to understand errors.

We drastically improved this feature, especially for users on Foundry. If you tried this before, we suggest giving it another whirl. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"441\" src=\"https:\/\/brandweaver.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/image-2-1024x441.png\" alt=\"Sidekik offers a Sync Directory feature to upload a smart contract project.

If you&#8217;re interested in exploring one or a few contracts from your local environment, we strongly recommend using a JSON file and uploading it using the &#8220;Sync File(s)&#8221; button. Regardless, <strong>you must identify each contract address and its ABI<\/strong>. There are three ways to do this:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. You output a JSON file during your compile process that saves the deployed addresses and ABI to a local file. [<strong>Strongly Recommended \ud83d\udcaa<\/strong>]<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. You point Sidekik to a directory to identify all ABIs (and addresses <em>if you are storing them to a file<\/em>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. You manually enter a contract addresses and ABI in the input box. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The third method is useful for contracts that are deployed to a chain. In a dev environment, that&#8217;s not the best way because addresses may change every time you deploy contracts.<br>For step-by-step instructions, along with a how-to video, go here: <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.brandweaver.ai\/setup\/overview\/setting-up-contracts-with-sidekik\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">https:\/\/docs.brandweaver.ai\/setup\/overview\/setting-up-contracts-with-sidekik<\/a> <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Now Supporting Overloaded Functions \ud83c\udd95 \ud83c\udf89<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to feedback from @ChiliPaneer, we&#8217;ve added support for overloaded functions. As a reminder, overloading a function means that you can create a function that has the same name but different arguments and\/or types. This is seen as three separate function calls in Sidekik, each with different input parameters: <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"348\" src=\"https:\/\/brandweaver.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/image-3-1024x348.png\" alt=\"Sidekik now supports overloaded functions in Solidity. \" class=\"wp-image-1150\" srcset=\"https:\/\/brandweaver.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/image-3-1024x348.png 1024w, https:\/\/brandweaver.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/image-3-300x102.png 300w, https:\/\/brandweaver.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/image-3-768x261.png 768w, https:\/\/brandweaver.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/image-3-1536x523.png 1536w, https:\/\/brandweaver.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/12\/image-3-2048x697.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Use Case: Exploring Hypotheses \ud83d\uddfa \ud83e\uddd0<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe you&#8217;ve heard that having more zeroes in a wallet address can save on gas fees. In this short video, Sandeep investigates this claim using Sidekik. Too-long-didn&#8217;t-watch (TLDW): Sandeep loads up the DAI contract and then impersonates a whale&#8217;s address. In one path, he transfers DAI to a typical wallet address and then measures the amount of gas it took. In a second path, he transfers DAI to an impersonated wallet address that is full of zeroes and measures its gas. After comparing the gas usage, he concludes that, yes, having more zeroes in your wallet address can result in gas savings!
