We began BD outreach to a dev tool influencers and authors who compile \u201cdev tool lists.\u201d This week, Sidekik was listed on the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/ConsenSys\/ethereum-developer-tools-list\" target=\"_blank\">ConsenSys Dev Tool<\/a> and the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/ethereumclassic.org\/development\/tooling\" target=\"_blank\">Ethereum Classic Dev Tool<\/a> lists.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Engaged User Sessions<\/strong>. User analytics show that some users spend 60+ minutes per session, while the average session is closer to 13 minutes. We\u2019re pondering, \u201chow do we turn those users into advocates?\u201d Your ideas are welcome.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Feedback &amp; Support<\/strong>. We added Intercom to capture feedback and offer support. One user already suggested a useful feature: saving contracts that they interact with frequently, because contracts currently disappear upon refreshing the page.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Challenges<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Sync Directory Feature<\/strong>. It seems most users do not save their contract address and ABIs to a local file, preferring to onboard via our \u2018sync directory\u2019 feature. Reading every file in the browser\u2019s main thread, however, was a painfully slow user experience. We updated our code this week, and we\u2019re now delivering a much faster experience.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Onboarding.<\/strong> Some devs did not successfully onboard last week. Sidekik was built as an internal tool for users who had prior knowledge of how to setup and get value. Obviously, that\u2019s not the case for a random developer coming to the web app for the first time. We see that stuck users read the browser\u2019s console logs, and so we updated the error messages there to provide more onboarding guidance. Second, we fixed a bug where people uploaded ABI files first and then connected a chain, which caused the UI to enter a glitchy loop:<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn-images-1.medium.com\/max\/800\/1*bHUYN6nqqs9c6-kqUI7yxQ.gif\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Asks<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>ETHDenver.<\/strong> We submitted applications to speak at <strong>ETHDenver<\/strong>.
